This repository contains the full coursework submission for COMP0118: *Computational Modeling in Biomedical Imaging* at UCL. The project focuses on the application of the **General Linear Model (GLM)** and **permutation testing** for statistical inference in neuroimaging, particularly with diffusion MRI data.

## Structure

- `COMP0118_Coursework2.pdf` — Final report including explanations, figures, and results.
- `Coursework2.pdf` — Project brief with full task specifications and guidelines.
- `Coursework2_Code.pdf` — Code listings of the MATLAB scripts used in the analysis.
- `MATLAB/` — Contains all MATLAB scripts and associated data files.

## Topics Covered

- Two-sample and paired t-tests via GLM
- Model design matrix construction
- Projection and residual analysis
- Parameter estimation and contrast testing
- Exact and approximate permutation tests
- Voxel-wise analysis and multiple comparison correction

## Requirements

- MATLAB (tested with R2023a or later)
  
## Usage

Navigate to the `MATLAB` directory and run the main scripts in order to replicate the results from the report. All intermediate steps and visualizations are reproducible from the provided code and data.
